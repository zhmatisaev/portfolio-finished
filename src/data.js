        answer: `
       <b> There are two main reasons why you need a Privacy Policy:</b> <br/>

        They're legally required <br/> 

        If you collect or use personal information, you'll have to comply 
        with privacy laws put in place around the world to protect consumer privacy. 
        These laws will apply regardless of where your business itself is located, as 
        they work to protect consumers in specific regions. For example, if your business is 
        located in the U.S. but you have users in the EU, the EU's GDPR will still apply to you.

        <br/> Consumers expect to see them <br/>

        In a world where consumer privacy is more important than ever and consumers are 
        starting to take their privacy more seriously, not having a Privacy Policy can mean 
        you may lose customers. People expect to see a Privacy Policy that they can easily 
        access whenever they want. Not having one will make you seem untrustworthy.
